KNEXMAIL TERMS OF SERVICE
Last Updated: [INSERT DATE]

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of https://knexmail.com (the “Site”) and KnexMail’s pre-launch waitlist (collectively, the “Services”). The Services are provided by KnexMail (“KnexMail,” “we,” “us,” or “our”).

• Receive transactional email updates related to the waitlist and referrals
• Share a referral link/code (if provided)

We do not guarantee that KnexMail will launch on any particular timeline or at all. Any launch targets, roadmaps, or feature descriptions are informational only and may change.

2. ELIGIBILITY
You must be at least 13 years old to use the Services. If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you may use the Services only with the consent of a parent or legal guardian.

You represent and warrant that:

We may withhold, cancel, or modify referral credit or rewards if we suspect abuse or violations.
