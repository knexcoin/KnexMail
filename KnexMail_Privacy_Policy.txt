KNEXMAIL PRIVACY POLICY
Last Updated: [INSERT DATE]

This Privacy Policy explains how KnexMail (“KnexMail,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, discloses, and protects information when you visit https://knexmail.com (the “Site”) and join our waitlist.

KnexMail is currently in a waitlist/pre-launch phase. The Site currently allows users to join a waitlist by providing an email address and selecting a username handle. The blockchain-based email platform is not yet launched. This policy applies to the waitlist and Site only, unless and until we publish an updated policy for the full product at launch.

1. WHO WE ARE (CONTROLLER INFORMATION)
Controller: KnexMail
Contact Email: noreply@knexmail.com
Company Location/Jurisdiction: [INSERT YOUR LOCATION/JURISDICTION]

If you are in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), United Kingdom, or Switzerland, KnexMail is the “data controller” of your personal data for the purposes of applicable data protection laws.

2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT
2.1 Information You Provide Voluntarily
When you join our waitlist, we collect:
• Email address
• Chosen username/handle

If you participate in referrals, we also process:
• Referral codes and referral relationships (e.g., who referred whom, referral counts)

2.2 Information Collected Automatically
When you visit the Site and/or join the waitlist, we may collect:
• IP address
• Device and browser information (such as user agent and approximate location derived from IP)
• Signup timestamps
• Basic site activity and logs (for security and performance)

2.3 Cookies and Similar Technologies
We may use cookies and similar technologies as described in our Cookie Policy to operate the Site and (if enabled) to measure traffic and usage.

3. HOW WE COLLECT INFORMATION
We collect information:
• Directly from you when you submit the waitlist signup form
• Automatically through server logs and (if enabled) analytics tools when you access the Site

4. WHY WE COLLECT INFORMATION (PURPOSES)
We collect and use your information to:
• Operate and administer the waitlist (including handle reservations)
• Send transactional emails related to the waitlist (e.g., confirmation/welcome emails, referral notifications)
• Track referral activity and waitlist status
• Maintain the security and integrity of the Site (fraud prevention, abuse detection, rate limiting)
• Analyze usage and improve the Site (where analytics are enabled)

5. LEGAL BASES FOR PROCESSING (GDPR/EEA/UK)
If you are in the EEA/UK/Switzerland, we rely on the following legal bases:
• Contract / steps prior to contract: Processing necessary to manage your waitlist signup and provide requested communications
• Legitimate interests: Protecting the Site, preventing fraud/abuse, and improving our services (where such interests are not overridden by your rights)
• Consent: For non-essential cookies and similar technologies where required (e.g., analytics cookies)

6. HOW WE USE INFORMATION
We use your information to:
• Create and manage your waitlist record (email + handle + referral data)
• Generate and send waitlist communications via AWS Simple Email Service (SES)
• Store waitlist data in AWS DynamoDB (US-EAST-1 region)
• Investigate and prevent suspicious or abusive activity
• Produce aggregated analytics and metrics that do not directly identify you

We do not use your waitlist information for targeted advertising, and we do not sell personal information.

7. HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION
We share information only as needed to operate the Site and waitlist:
• AWS (Amazon Web Services) as our hosting and infrastructure provider, including DynamoDB for database storage and SES for transactional email delivery

We may also disclose information:
• To comply with law, legal process, or government requests
• To protect the rights, property, and safety of KnexMail, our users, or others
• In connection with a corporate transaction (e.g., merger, acquisition, financing, or sale of assets), subject to appropriate confidentiality protections

8. DATA STORAGE, LOCATION, AND INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS
Waitlist data is stored in AWS DynamoDB in the US-EAST-1 region (United States). If you access the Site from outside the United States, your information may be transferred to and processed in the United States and other locations where our service providers operate.

For EEA/UK/Swiss users, where required, we use appropriate safeguards for international transfers, such as Standard Contractual Clauses or other lawful transfer mechanisms.

9. DATA RETENTION
We retain waitlist information:
• Until the product launches or as long as needed to manage the waitlist and related communications; or
• Until you request deletion, whichever comes first

We may retain limited information for longer periods if required for legal compliance, security, fraud prevention, or to resolve disputes.

10. SECURITY
We use reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect your information, such as:
• Encryption in transit (TLS) for data submitted to the Site
• Encryption at rest for stored data (including AWS-managed encryption for DynamoDB where configured)
• Access controls and least-privilege permissions
• Logging and monitoring for abuse detection and operational security

No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

11. DATA BREACHES
If we become aware of a data breach that affects your personal information, we will take reasonable steps to investigate, mitigate harm, and notify affected users and/or regulators when required by applicable law (including GDPR’s notification requirements).
